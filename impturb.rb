# Version: v.01 alpha-protoplasm - design 10.03 hours to 23.27 hours, 15 May 2016
# Programming Language: Ruby version 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786)

# Working Title: Program to calculate impulse turbine power output
# 
# Design Notes for deletion when programme works: math direction...create relevant equations

# First Principles - Pressure = Force/Area
# 1 Pascal (pressure) = 1 newton of force per square meter
# 1 Bar = 100,000 Pascals
# 1 metric horsepower = 75kg of force per square meter = 735.5 Watts
# Power (mechanical power in Watts) = torque (n.m) * angular speed (in radians per second); equivalently use RPM which is simpler...
# for end users - divide by 60 for RPM
# P = T*2π*(N/60)
# where P = mechanical power in watts; T = torque in Newton Meters (n.m), and N = RPM (revolutions per minute)

# List of Variables
# [[h = head in meters (i.e. distance travelled by working fluid before striking pitch circle diameter of impulse turbine) not needed here]]
# njet = number of jets
# fjet = jet force in Newtons
# nforce = proportion of force producing output torque (0.95 is normally a reasonable estimate)
# D = Pitch Circle Diameter of impulse turbine (meters)
# rpm = runner speed in revolutions per minute
# x = mechanical power in watts???
#
#
# 
#
# Pmech (watts) = Fjet x Njet x pi x h x w x d / 60


#Fjet = Force in Newtons

#Njet = number of jets eg 1 jet nozzle

#pi = 3.141592654 etc

#h = efficiency coefficient (unit-less fraction between 0 and 1) = eg 0.85 (always going to be a figure between 0.69 and 0.94...
# Larger they are, the more efficient

#d = diameter of turbine in metres (circle representing the pitch circle diameter of the turbine, that is, a circle the diameter of which represents the point where the working fluid noozle strikes the circular turbine which will not normally be the outermost edge of the turbine)

#w = rpm (i.e note the method of conversion from radians per second to rpm by dividing by 60) = eg for example 1200 rpm

#Accordingly, applying a Pmech equation example:

#170,000 (watts) = Fjet (10,006 Newtons) x Njet (1) x pi (3.141592654 etc) x h (0.85) x w (mystery value being rpm) x d (0.87m) / 60

#= 10,006 X 1 X Pi x 0.85 x RPM x 0.87 / 60
#= 23246 x w / 60
#170,000 = 23246w / 60
#170,000 = 387.4333w
#w = 438.78 RPM

# Have to subtract vb from vj per Mb = Ajet . (vj - vb) . pwater
# Why? Becuse runner speed may not exceed 50% of noozle jet velocity
# Why? See derivation infra
# x = optimal speed ratio as between runner (i.e. cup velocity) and vjet:
#x = vb / vj
#x = ratio
#vb = Cup velocity at pitch circle diameter of turbine
#vj = Jet velocity
#F = mb. vj . (1-x) (1+ z.cos g)
#h = mb . (vj . vj) . x . (1-x) . (1+z.cosg) / Â½ . mb (vj . vj)
#P = F . vb = mb . vj . (1-x) . (1+z.cos g) . vb  = mb . vj . x . (1-x) . (1+z.cos g)
#dh / dx = 2(1-2x). (1+z.cos g) = 0
#x = 0.5
 
 
#h = system efficiency as a unit-less fraction between zero and one
#F = force of water on cups (N)
#mb = mass flow rate into cup (kg/s)
#vj = Jet velocity (m/s)
#vb = runner tangential velocity at pitch circle diameter (m/s)
#z = efficiency factor for flow in buckets (unit-less fraction between zero and 1)
#g = angle of sides of cups
#x = speed ratio of vj to vb


#Maths - keep it as simple as a dimple wearing a wimple

#Water Jet Velocity (Vjet)

#Bernoulli equation gives velocity of water jet (v = vjet) applied to a turbine.

#P = Â½ r . V2

#P = Pressure (401,536 Pa)
#rho = density (1020kg/m3)
#V = velocity (m/s) mystery value

#401536 = Â½ 1020 . V2
#401536 = 510 . V2
#V2 = 401,536 / 510
#V = 28 m/s

#Force of water Jet (Fjet)

# 1 m3/s of seawater (1020kg/m3) represents a flow rate of 1020kg/s.
# 1000kg/m3 for freshwater is better but wtf.
# F = 1020kg/s x 28 m/s/s
# = 28560 Newtons...actually right though an enormous figure in that example

#Fjet Momentum Change Calculation

#Turbine speed may not exceed 50% of water jet speed. Hence...

#Vjet = 28 m/s
#Vrunner = 14 m/s

#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x Delta V
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x (Vjet - Vrunner)
#Delta Mom = 1020kg/s x (28 m/s - 14 m/s)
#Delta Mom = 14280 N (for this example)

#Fjet = 14280N.

#Turbine RPM

# Can now calc the RPM figure for a turbine based on runner velocity
# of 14 m/s.

# First need circumference of turbine. For example:

# Diameter = 0.9m
# radius = 0.45m
# 2.pi.r = 2.827433388m (circumference)

# Vrunner = 14 m/s
# RPS = 4.951487 (revolutions per second) x 60
# = 297 RPM
# wtf

# Power Output
# Applying 297 RPM and Fjet = 14280 Newtons to Pmech equation:

# Pmech = Fjet x Njet x pi x flowrate x RPM x 0.9 x 0.87m / 60
# need to check all of this - why would you have flowrate and Fjet in the same equation...meh
# = 14280N x 1(jet) x pi x 1m3/s x 297RPM x 0.9(eff) x 0.87m / 60
# = 173Kw
# wtf
# Cross referencing this output figure with the conventional equation for electrical power output in watts:

# Pwatts = h(25m) x g(9.81 m/s/s) x rho (1020kg/m3) x 0.9 (eff) x 1m3/s (flow)
# = 225kW
# explanation for the different results? Flowrate of less than 1 m3/s is not needed and brings the figure down as lower value than 1.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#

# [need code to calc fjet before applying value to pmech equation and maths to calc fjet via bernoulli/pressure calcs]
# lots of work here and not mathematically accurate atm and would be nice to geolocate the gravity locus concept for accuracy
# linking to a url and grabbing gravity data for their locus (optional for users who want that sort of accuracy
# Inane fuckery required atm with existing web resources. Really needs to be simplified.
# And programming a discrete grav locus calculaton programme should be relatively trivial if already done for this programme


# Amother example continuing looking at the maths
# Bernoulli equation gives jet velocity.

# P = Â½ r . V2

# P = Pressure (Pa)
#rho = density (kg/m3)
#rho = density (kg/m3)
#V = velocity (m/s)
#V = velocity (m/s)
#P = 160 bar = 16,000,000 Pa = 16,000,000 N/m2
#rho fresh water = 1000 kg/m3
#The mystery value is velocity (m/s)
#16,000,000 = Â½ 1000 . V2
#V = 178.8854382 m/s

#Newton gives us Force (per mass x acceleration)
#F = m.a
#F = 0.16kg/s x 179 m/s
#F = 28.64 Newtons

#Note again (see supra) that Turbine at its most efficient when the runner travels at half jet speed ie here at 89.5 m/s
# very high rpm possible but not under load. Torque and rpm have essentiallty inverse relationship.  

#The Change in momentum of the jet (assuming water leaves cups with zero absolute tangential velocity) balances force applied to cup.

#Accordingly:
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x Delta V
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x (Vjet/Vrunner equation)
#Delta Mom = 0.16 x (179 - 89.5)
#Delta Mom = 14.3 N

# The x= 0.5 delta v speed limit again here


#Bernoulli's equation gives jet velocity.

#P = ½rho *v2

#Example of vjet calculation where pressure and density known
#P = Pressure (352,000 Pa)
#rho = density (1020kg/m3)
#V = velocity (m/s) mystery value
#352,000 = ½ 1020 . V2
#352,000 = 510 . V2
#V2 = 352,000 / 510
#V = 26.2 m/s
#Note that higher system pressure eg 450,000 Pa would give vjet (jet velocity) of 29.7 m/s.

#A mass flow rate of 1 m3/s (1020kg/s) provides the following Force figures in Newtons depending on velocity:

#F = 1020kg/s x 26.2 m/s/s
#= 26,724 Newtons - ludicrously high force figure but looks accurate due to huge mass flow rate (1 cubic meter per second of seawater)

#F = 1020kg/s x 29.7 m/s/s
#= 30,294 Newtons
# wtf
#Applying figures supra to Pmech equation for mechanical power output in watts (based on estimated RPM of say 100 RPM at Fjet values of 26724N and 30294N respectively

#Pmech = Fjet x Njet x pi x flowrate x RPM x 0.85 / 60
#= 26724N x 1 x pi x 1m3/s x 100 x 0.85  / 60
#= 118Kw

#= 30294N x 1 x pi x 1m3/s x 100 x 0.85  / 60
#= 134.8Kw
# why 'flowrate' here in the first of the two equations as you already have Fjet (force in newtons) and if...
# mass flow rate is already a fucking component of the force figure (having already been taken into account)...check
# ...homegrown equations against texts

#continuing...accordingly
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x Delta V
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x (Vjet - Vrunner)
#Delta Mom = 0.16 x (179 - 89.5)
#Delta Mom = 14.3 N


# ***************************
#Bernoulli's equation gives jet velocity vjet.

#P = ½rho *v2
# where P = pressure in Pascals, rho = density in kg/m3 and v = velocity in m/s

#If the pressure of working fluid is known, velocity when it strikes turbine may be calculated

#For example, if pressure, P = 352,000 Pa
#and rho or fluid density = 1020 kg/m3 (as is approx the case for seawater)
#velocity or v (m/s) is the only remaining mystery value, and may be calculated as follows:

#352,000 (P) = ½ 1020 * v2
#352,000 = 510 * v2
#v2 = 352,000 / 510
#v = 26.2 m/s

# velocity of the working fluid is now known (26.2m/s) from which Fjet may be provided once the flowrate in m3/s is known

# How calculate Flowrate?

# Force = mass x acceleration
# F = m.a
# F = 0.16kg/s x 26.2 m/s
# F = [] Newtons

#Note that impulse turbines are most efficient when the runner travels at half the jet speed
# so if jet speed (vjet) is 179m/s then optimal runner velocity (turbine pitch circle diameter speed) will be 89.5 m/s

#The Change in momentum of the jet (assuming the water jet leaves the cups with zero absolute tangential velocity) will balance the force applied to the cup.

#Accordingly:
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x Delta v (where delta v is the difference)
#Delta Mom = mass flow rate x (Vjet - Vrunner)
#Delta Mom = 0.16 x (179 - 89.5)
#Delta Mom = 14.3 N
# enough theory and repetition
# Code conceptual framwork

# problem with v.01? Lots of issues. x wa used for delta v calcs but is also being used to represent pmech! wtf
# and worse, x was also assigned to fucking flowrate which was probably not even needed as you had already had a Newton figure - meh
#
# The floating point problem sucks...leads to answers of 'infinity watts' when running it...second law violations always a bad sign
# meh
# ...if flowrate or indeed any other variable is less than 1...infinite kW error appears 
# Mathematically a mess for above reasons but not too far away from being a useful chunk of speciality code.
